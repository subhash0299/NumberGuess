# Number Guessing Game

## Description

The **Number Guessing Game** is a simple Python-based game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number. The game prompts the player to enter a range for the number to be guessed (greater than 9), and the player will then guess numbers within that range. The game provides feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

The game is built using the **Tkinter** library to create a graphical user interface (GUI), making it interactive and user-friendly.

## Features

- Allows the user to set the upper limit of the guessing range (greater than 9).
- Provides feedback for guesses (too high, too low, or correct).
- Option to play again after guessing correctly.
- Simple and intuitive user interface with buttons, labels, and input fields.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You will also need the **Tkinter** library (which is included by default in most Python installations).

1. Install Python: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Tkinter is included by default in standard Python distributions, so no additional installation is needed for Tkinter.

### Steps to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/subhash0299/NumberGuessingGame.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd NumberGuessingGame
   ```

3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python numguess.py
   ```

4. The game window should open, and you can start playing!

## Usage

1. Enter a number greater than 9 in the input field to set the range for the number to be guessed.
2. Click the **Start Game** button to generate the random number and begin guessing.
3. Enter your guess in the input field and click **Submit Guess**.
4. The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. After guessing correctly, you will be prompted to play again.

## Example

Hereâ€™s what the game looks like:

1. You will be asked to enter a number greater than 9 (e.g., 100).
2. The game will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
3. You will input guesses, and the game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.
4. Once you guess the correct number, you can choose to play again.
